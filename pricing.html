            <p>
              There is no time limit of the free trial, so you can use the trial
              as long as you want. However, there are several feature limits:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>At most 2 connection favorites</li>

          <h3>Should I buy Medis on the Mac App Store or from your website?</h3>
          <div>
            <p><strong>TL;DR</strong> It's totally up to you. 😃</p>
            <p>
              There is no difference in functionality between the two versions.
              In terms of product design, we also try to avoid adding
              differentiated features in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many users prefer the App Store version because they can manage
              all their softwares in one place. At the same time, some of our
              enterprise users need to be able to purchase software outside of
              the App Store.
