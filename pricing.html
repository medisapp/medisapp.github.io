        <h3>What are the limitations of the free trial?</h3>

            We may change the limitations without any notifications in the
            future releases. The current ones are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>At most 1 saved connection</li>
            <li>At most 1 database window</li>
            <li>Alert mode is not available</li>
            <li>Bookmark is not available</li>
            <li>Command autocompleter is not available</li>

        <h3>Can I buy Medis for my team?</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            Of course! During the checkout process, you can select the quantity and enter the number of people for whom
            you are purchasing Medis. You will receive a separate license key for each person.

      <div class="question">
        <h3>Should I buy Medis on the Mac App Store or from your website?</h3>
        <div>
          <p><strong>TL;DR</strong> It's totally up to you. ðŸ˜ƒ</p>
          <p>
            There is no difference in functionality between the two versions.
            In terms of product design, we also try to avoid adding
            differentiated features in the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many users prefer the App Store version because they can manage
            all their softwares in one place. At the same time, some of our
            enterprise users need to be able to purchase software outside of
            the App Store.
