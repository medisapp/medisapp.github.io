        <h1>Terms and Conditions ("Terms")</h1>
        <p>Effective date: July 29, 2021</p>
        <p>
          Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms and
          Conditions") carefully before using Medis (the "Service") operated by
          Medis ("us", "we", or "our").
        </p>
        <p>
          Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your
          acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to
          all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these
          Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you may not
          access the Service.
        </p>
        <h3>Subscriptions</h3>
        <p>
          Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis
          ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and
          periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a
          monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan
          you select when purchasing a Subscription.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically
          renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or we
          cancel it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal through your
          online account management page.
        </p>
        <p>
          A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process
          the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide us with accurate
          and complete billing information including full name, address, state,
          zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By
          submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize Medis
          to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any
          such payment instruments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, we will issue
          an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually,
          within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to
          the billing period as indicated on the invoice.
        </p>
        <h3>Free Trial</h3>
        <p>
          Medis may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free
          trial for a limited period of time ("Free Trial").
        </p>
        <p>
          You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign
          up for the Free Trial.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you do enter your billing information when signing up for the Free
          Trial, you will not be charged by Medis until the Free Trial has
          expired. On the last day of the Free Trial period, unless you
          cancelled your Subscription, you will be automatically charged the
          applicable Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you have
          selected.
        </p>
        <p>
          At any time and without notice, Medis reserves the right to (i) modify
          the terms and conditions of the Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such
          Free Trial offer.
        </p>
        <h3>Fee Changes</h3>
        <p>
          Medis, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the
          Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change
          will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Medis will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in
          Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your
          Subscription before such change becomes effective.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change
          comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified
          Subscription fee amount.
        </p>
        <h3>Refunds</h3>
        <p>
          Except when required by law, paid Subscription fees are
          non-refundable.

          Upon termination, your right to use the Service will immediately
          cease.

          without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other
